# Hello_World
My first repository.
I am a biology undergraduate pursuing a minor in geospatial information analysis. My school is Boise State University and I plan to graduate end of Spring 2023. I will go on to receive a Masterâ€™s and Ph.D. with my focus on marine ecosystems and marine life. I have become more interested in photogrammetry using unoccupied aerial systems (AUS) since working in the Caughlin lab over the last year. I use overlapping images and gps to create orthomosaics, dense point clouds, digital surface models and maps.
